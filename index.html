                    <p>
                       Everybody has a different concept of what the word risk means so before recommending an investment, we carry out an ‘Attitude to Risk’ analysis that is personal to you so that your investment is matched to your own personal risk rating plus we then offer regular reviews which includes a review of your attitude to risk in order to ensure that your investment remains suitable.

                    <p>
                        Yes, there are products that contain guarantees which are designed to provide peace of mind to first time investors but which also appeal to the more cautious, however they usually come with an additional cost.

                    <p>
                        There is no need to tie your money up for any specific time period and is down to your own personal requirements although it is recommended that stock market related investments should be envisaged to be kept for 3 to 5 years.

                    <p>
                        Different products are taxed in different ways at different times, some are taxed at source, some are assessed for tax on encashment and some are free of tax so before recommending any investments we establish your current tax situation and take into account any future possible impact on that situation.
